    <p>I'm John Jacobsen, a web developement student at Seattle Central Community College. As part of my course load, I was asked to write this portal page, and to fill it with at least two paragraphs worth of information on myself.</p>
    
    <p>I am a welder and shipfitter by trade, with professional experience at shipyards and architectural shops up and down the west coast. I've decided to change careers, however, and am giving web developement a try.</p>
    
    <p>My interests include reading (mostly non-fiction), watching movies, and writing. The more I have learned about web developement, however, the more interested I have become in it, maybe especially in the design aspects of it.</p>
